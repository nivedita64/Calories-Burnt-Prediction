# Calories-Burnt-Prediction
This project predicts calories burnt using machine learning. I performed complete data analysis and visualization using libraries like 
<br>
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Key steps included:
<br>
Explored and cleaned the dataset
<br>
Found correlations between features
<br>
Visualized insights
<br>
Trained an XGBoost Regressor model using Scikit-learn
<br>
Evaluated the model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
